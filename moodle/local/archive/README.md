## ARCHIVES

By using the archives' plugin of the Moodle, the user can reach the old exams, questions, practice questions and many more
things that a student can benefit from. This plugin is helpful for students in distant/online classes since students cannot 
go to school face to face. Therefore, a system of previous resources of a class can be beneficial to someone in need 
of course materials.

Courses Short Name should be the name of the class. For Example: Bil 470.

Courses Long Name should be the full name of the class. Example: Machine Learning.

Record Type can be consisting of:
1) Midterm Exam
2) Quiz
3) Final Exam
4) HW
5) Practice Questions
6) Slides
7) Solution of exams/quiz/questions and etc...

Record Date is the date of the previous exams year. (Ex: if a midterm is made in 2016, then it should be labeled as 2016. 
it can also be recorded as the full date.)

Creation of the archive record should be held in the system. (When was this record created?)
